well, i started off by borrowing images from other people; creating the skeleton html,
then polished with css of course.

Javascript/Jquery:
I established variables for all crystal random numbers, and the computer generated random number,
and variables for the loss/win counters.

I decided to make a reset function instead of writing in the reset to each condition.
I also made a winning and losing function to avoid writing that into each condition as well.

Then after that it was just the simple matter of telling the servers to activate the buttons on click, and add the appropriate random number to the player's score,
while throwing the win/loss condition functions in each 'on click' button.
